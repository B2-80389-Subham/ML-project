# Diabetes Risk Prediction Project

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. It is a major global health concern, affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing diabetes and preventing its complications. This project aims to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to develop predictive models for identifying individuals at high risk of developing diabetes.

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes risk. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist in early detection and intervention for individuals susceptible to diabetes.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a predictive model for diabetes risk assessment.
- Evaluate and fine-tune the model using relevant datasets.
- Provide insights and visualizations to enhance understanding.

## Data

The project utilizes Actual data of patients[CDC].
